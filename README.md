# Space Voyege - Planetary Tourism Office

## HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY

In the distant future, space tourism will likely be routine for Earth dwellers, but space travelers will need help choosing a destination and determining an itinerary. Imagine you are a travel agent at a future space tourism office. Your challenge is to create a tool that will not only develop customized itineraries for future travelers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system—perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn—but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system.

## DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION

As per the challenge, we’re in a future where inter-planetary traveling has become as common as it is to use airplanes in the current times. So, to tackle the the problem of the future citizens who wants to travel not to other countries, but to other planets of our solar system, we have built an web application for a traveling agency which not only solves the problem of making it hassle free to book, travel and learn about different planets and other objects, it also provides much more value too.

## HOW IT WORKS

The system structure of our Space Voyage initiative employs a MERN stack, leveraging MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. User engagement occurs through front-end components and services created using HTML5, CSS3, React, and JavaScript. On the server-side, Node.js and Express manage routing and controllers while interfacing with NASA's Space API for real-time data. The Mongoose model communicates seamlessly with MongoDB for efficient data storage. This tech stack guarantees a smooth and responsive user interface, adaptable to both the website and the mobile app. React ensures uniformity, and the collaboration of back-end processes and API integration produces a lively platform for users to navigate the cosmos effortlessly and accurately.

## FEATURES & SOLUTIONS

As stated in the project description, we have tried to provide solutions to multiple problems in a single place. And this has been done through a website and an app.

**Website Features:**

- *Direct Booking and Exclusive Hotel Deals:*
   Users can conveniently book their destinations directly through the website. Additionally, they get insights into popular destinations chosen by fellow tourists, and exclusive hotel deals are available exclusively on the website.

- *Intuitive UI with Eye-Catching Colors:*
   The website boasts an intuitive user interface, employing eye-catching color schemes suitable for all users, including those with color perception issues.

- *Robust Security with OTP Feature:*
   To ensure the security of user accounts, the website incorporates a robust OTP feature, providing extended protection.

**Mobile App Features:**

- *Neatly Organized for Smooth User Experience:*
   Recognizing the predominant use of mobile phones, the mobile app is meticulously organized to offer users a seamless and user-friendly experience.

- *Focused Travel Pages:*
   The app features three main pages directly addressing the user's primary need: traveling. These pages provide quick access to information, planning, and booking.

- *Interactive Planet Exploration:*
   Users are greeted with the most visited planets on opening the app, each accompanied by a short bio. While these are highlights, users can explore more destinations. The second page offers detailed information for tour planning, and the third page finalizes ticket bookings for one or more destinations.

- *Diverse Services and Features:*
   Beyond booking, the app provides access to various services and features. Users can engage with VR, participate in forums, play games, stay updated with news and space events through live streams, and even purchase space-related items like suits and food. Guides are available for an enhanced touring experience on the desired planet.

## TECH STACK

To come up with the solution to our problem, we will be utilizing the most popular web stack; the MERN stack. It comprises MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js. This allows us to use publicly available open-source resources which ultimately provide a buttery smooth web application.

## HACKATHON JOURNEY

Our journey into the realm of hackathons unfolds with a team bound not just by academic pursuits but a shared vision for creating meaningful and sustainable solutions. Comprising five like-minded members pursuing the same degree at our university, we found each other in classrooms where our shared passion for making a positive impact blossomed.

The spark for our participation in the "NASA International Space Apps Challenge" ignited through the guidance of a senior, and here we are, driven by a collective desire to build something transformative. As we embark on this hackathon journey, our goal is clear — not just to participate, but to craft a solution that instigates positive change and progress. Together, we pool our knowledge, skills, and shared commitment to create an innovative and impactful contribution to the future.

## HOW TO RUN

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
